# tap-i18n

A comprehensive internationalization solution for Meteor

### Internationalization for Meteor

**tap-i18n** is a [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com) package that provides a comprehensive [i18n](http://www.i18nguy.com/origini18n.html) solution for Meteor apps and packages,
with the goal of standardizing the way package developers internationalize their
packages.

## Key Features

### All Encompassing

tap-i18n is designed in a way that distinguishes the role of the package developer, that is, making the package available in multiple languages, from the role of the app developer which is to translate the app, but more importantly, to manage the app's internationalization aspects, such as: setting the supported languages for the project, setting the client language, configuring CDNs for language files, and so on.

### Readable Syntax

```handlebars
<div class="btn">{{_ "sign_up"}}</div>
```

### Advanced i18n

tap-i18n uses [i18next](http://i18next.com/) as its internationalization engine and exposes all its capabilities to the Meteor's templates - variables, dialects, count/context aware keys, and more.

**client/messages.html**

```handlebars
<template name="messages_today">
  <p>{{_ "inbox_status" "Daniel" count=18}}</p>
</template>
```

**i18n/en.i18n.json**

```json
{
  "inbox_status": "Hey, %s! You have received one new message today.",
  "inbox_status_plural": "Hey, %s! You have received %s new messages today."
}
```
See more examples below.

### Transparent Namespacing

You don't need to worry about domain prefixing or package conflicts when you translate your project or package. Behind the scenes we automatically generate scoped namesapaces for you.

### Ready to Scale

* Translations are unified into a single JSON file per language that includes both package and project-level translations
* On-demand: translations are loaded only when they are needed
* 3rd Party CDN Support


## Quickstart

**Step 1:** Install tap-i18n using meteor:

```bash
$ meteor add tap:i18n
```

**Step 2:** Add translation helpers to your markup:

**\*.html**

```handlebars
<div>{{_ "hello"}}</div>
```

**Step 3:** Define translations in JSON format:

**i18n/en.i18n.json**

```json
{ "hello": "Hey there" }
```

**i18n/fr.i18n.json**

```json
{ "hello": "Bonjour" }
```

Translations files should end with lang_tag.i18n.json.

You can split translations of a certain language to multiple files, we ignore
the prefixed text, e.g., we add the translations of menu.en.i18n.json in the
same way we add those of en.i18n.json .

You can put languages files anywhere in your project tree, as long as they are
common to both your server and client - **do not put languages files under
/client, /server or /public**.

**Step 4:** Initiate the client language on startup (optional)

If you want the client to be served by a specific language on startup

Assuming that you have a function getUserLanguage() that returns the language
for tag for the current user.

```javascript
getUserLanguage = function () {
  // Put here the logic for determining the user language

  return "fr";
};

if (Meteor.isClient) {
  Meteor.startup(function () {
    Session.set("showLoadingIndicator", true);

    TAPi18n.setLanguage(getUserLanguage())
      .done(function () {
        Session.set("showLoadingIndicator", false);
      })
      .fail(function (error_message) {
        // Handle the situation
        console.log(error_message);
      });
  });
}
```

* If you won't set a language on startup your project will be served in the
  fallback language: English
* You probably want to show a loading indicator until the language is ready (as
  shown in the example), otherwise the templates in your projects will be in
  English until the language will be ready

## Documentation & Examples

### TAPi18n API

**TAPi18n.setLanguage(language\_tag) (Client)**

Sets the client's translation language.

Returns a jQuery deferred object that resolves if the language load
succeed and fails otherwise.

**Notes:**

  * language\_tag has to be a supported Language.
  * jQuery deferred docs: [jQuery Deferred](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/)

**TAPi18n.getLanguage() (Client)**

Returns the tag of the client's current language or null if
tap-i18n is not installed.

If inside a reactive computation, invalidate the computation the next time the
client language get changed (by TAPi18n.setLanguage)

**TAPi18n.getLanguages() (Anywhere)**

Returns an object with all the supported languages and their names.

A language is considred supported if it is in the supported_languages array of
the project-tap.i18n json. If supported_languages is null or not defined in
project-tap.i18n we consider all the languages we find *.i18n.json files to as
supported.

The returned object is in the following format:

```javascript
{
  'en': {
    'name':'English', // Local name
    'en':'English'    // English name
  },
  'zh': {
    'name':'中文'     // Local name
    'en':'Chinese'    // English name
  }
  .
  .
  .
}
```

**TAPi18n.__(key, options, lang_tag=null) (Anywhere)**

*If `lang_tag` is null:*

Translates key to the current client's language. If inside a reactive
computation, invalidate the computation the next time the client language get
changed (by TAPi18n.setLanguage).

*Otherwise:*

Translates key to lang_tag. if you use `lang_tag` you should use `__` in a
reactive computation since the string will be translated to the current client
language if a translator to lang_tag is not ready in the client (if called for
the first time with that lang_tag, or until language data load from the server
finishes) and will get invalidated (trigger reactivity) when the translator to
that lang_tag is ready to be used to translate the key.

Using `i18next.t` `lng` option or `lang`, which we made as alias to `lang` in
tap:i18n, is equivalent to setting the `lang_tag` attribute.

The function is a proxy to the i18next.t() method.
Refer to the [documentation of i18next.t()](http://i18next.com/pages/doc_features.html)
to learn about its possible options.

**On the server**, TAPi18n.__ is not a reactive resource. You have to specify
the language tag you want to translate the key to.

**TAPi18n.loadTranslations(translations, namespace="project") (Anywhere)**

Use *translations* in addition or instead of the translations defined in the
i18n.json files. Translations defined by loadTranslations will have priority
over those defined in language files (i18n.json) of *namespace* (the project,
or package name).

To enjoy [the benefits of tap:i18n](#key-features), you should use language
files to internationalize your project whenever you can.

Legitimate cases for *loadTranslations* are:

* Allowing users to change the project translations
* Changing translations of 3rd party packages that you don't want to fork (see
  the Note below).

Example:

```javascript
TAPi18n.loadTranslations(
    {
        es: {
            meteor_status_waiting: "Desconectado"
        },
        fr: {
            meteor_status_failed: "La connexion au serveur a Ã©chouÃ©"
        }
    },
    "francocatena:status"
);
```

**Arguments:**

* `translations`: An object of the following format:

```javascript
{
    'lang-tag': {
        'translation-key1': 'translation',
        'translation-key2': 'translation',
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

* `namespace="project"`: The namespace you want to add the translations to. by
  default translations are added to the project namespace, if you want to
  change a package translation use the package name as the namespace like the
  above example.

**Notes:**

* **Adding support to a new language in your app:** You can't use
  *addTranslations* in order to add support to a new language, that is, to allow
  users to change the interface language of the app to that language. In order
  to start support a new language in your app, you'll have to either add a
  language file to that language (*.i18n.json file) or add that languages to your
  project-tap.i18n file.

* **Translating a package that uses tap:i18n to another language**: If you want
  to add a new language to a 3rd party package (and you can't get it's owner to
  merge your pull request) consider introducing a "translation" package in which
  package-tap.i18n has the "namespace" options set to the package you are
  translating. That way you can translate with languages files instead of
  *addTranslations* and share your translation package with others.

### The tap-i18n Helpers

### The \_  Helper

To use tap-i18n to internationalize your templates you can use the \_ helper
that we set on the project's templates and on packages' templates for packages
that uses tap-i18n:

    {{_ "key" "sprintf_arg1" "sprintf_arg2" ... op1="option-value" op2="option-value" ... }}

**You can customize the helper name, see "Configuring tap-i18n" section.**

The translation files that will be used to translate key depends on the
template from which it is being used:
* If the helper is being used in a template that belongs to a package that uses
  tap-i18n we'll always look for the translation in that package's translation
  files.
* If the helper is being used in one of the project's templates we'll look for
  the translation in the project's translation files (tap-i18n has to be
  installed of course).

**Usage Examples:**

Assuming the client language is en.

**Example 1:** Simple key:

    en.i18n.json:
    -------------
    {
        "click": "Click Here",
        "html_key": "<b>BOLD</b>"
    }

    page.html:
    ----------
    <template name="x">
        {{_ "click"}}
        {{{_ "html_key"}}} <!-- Note that we use triple {{{ for html rendering -->
    </template>

    output:
    -------
    Click Here
    <b>BOLD</b>

**Example 2:** Simple key specific language:

    en.i18n.json:
    -------------
    {
        "click": "Click Here"
    }

    fr.i18n.json:
    -------------
    {
        "click": "Cliquez Ici"
    }

    page.html (lng and lang options are the same in tap:i18n you can use both):
    ----------
    <template name="x">
        {{_ "click" lang="fr"}} 
    </template>

    <template name="x">
        {{_ "click" lng="fr"}} 
    </template>

    output:
    -------
    Cliquez Ici

**Example 3:** Sprintf:

    en.i18n.json:
    -------------
    {
        "hello": "Hello %s, your last visit was on: %s"
    }

    page.html:
    ----------
    <template name="x">
        {{_ "hello" "Daniel" "2014-05-22"}}
    </template>

    output:
    -------
    Hello Daniel, your last visit was on: 2014-05-22

**Example 4:** Named variables and sprintf:

    en.i18n.json:
    -------------
    {
        "hello": "Hello __user_name__, your last visit was on: %s"
    }

    page.html:
    ----------
    <template name="x">
        {{_ "hello" "2014-05-22" user_name="Daniel"}}
    </template>

    output:
    -------
    Hello Daniel, your last visit was on: 2014-05-22

**Note:** Named variables have to be after all the sprintf parameters.

**Example 5:** Named variables, sprintf, singular/plural:

    en.i18n.json:
    -------------
    {
        "inbox_status": "__username__, You have a new message (inbox last checked %s)",
        "inbox_status_plural": "__username__, You have __count__ new messages (last checked %s)"
    }

    page.html:
    ----------
    <template name="x">
        {{_ "inbox_status" "2014-05-22" username="Daniel" count=1}}
        {{_ "inbox_status" "2014-05-22" username="Chris" count=4}}
    </template>

    output:
    -------
    Daniel, You have a new message (inbox last checked 2014-05-22)
    Chris, You have 4 new messages (last checked 2014-05-22)

**Example 6:** Singular/plural, context:

    en.i18n.json:
    -------------
    {
        "actors_count": "There is one actor in the movie",
        "actors_count_male": "There is one actor in the movie",
        "actors_count_female": "There is one actress in the movie",
        "actors_count_plural": "There are __count__ actors in the movie",
        "actors_count_male_plural": "There are __count__ actors in the movie",
        "actors_count_female_plural": "There are __count__ actresses in the movie",
    }

    page.html:
    ----------
    <template name="x">
        {{_ "actors_count" count=1 }}
        {{_ "actors_count" count=1 context="male" }}
        {{_ "actors_count" count=1 context="female" }}
        {{_ "actors_count" count=2 }}
        {{_ "actors_count" count=2 context="male" }}
        {{_ "actors_count" count=2 context="female" }}
    </template>

    output:
    -------
    There is one actor in the movie
    There is one actor in the movie
    There is one actress in the movie
    There are 2 actors in the movie
    There are 2 actors in the movie
    There are 2 actresses in the movie

* Refer to the [documentation of i18next.t()](http://i18next.com/pages/doc_features.html)
  to learn more about its possible options.
* The translation will get updated automatically after calls to
  TAPi18n.setLanguage().

### More helpers

**{{languageTag}}:**

The {{languageTag}} helper calls TAPi18n.getLanguage().

It's useful when you need to load assets depending on the current language, for
example:

```handlebars
<template name="example">
  <img src="welcome_{{languageTag}}.png">
</template>
```

### Languages Tags and Translations Prioritization

We use the [IETF language tag system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag)
for languages tagging. With it developers can refer to a certain language or
pick one of its dialects.

Example: A developer can either refer to English in general using: "en" or to
use the Great Britain dialect with "en-GB".

**If tap-i18n is install** we'll attempt to look for a translation of a certain
string in the following order:
* Language dialect, if specified ("pt-BR")
* Base language ("pt")
* Base English ("en")

**Notes:**

* We currently support only one dialect level. e.g. nan-Hant-TW is not
  supported.
* "en-US" is the dialect we use for the base English translations "en".
* If tap-i18n is not installed, packages will be served in English, the fallback language.

### Structure of Languages Files

Languages files should be named: arbitrary.text.lang_tag.i18n.json . e.g., en.i18n.json, menu.pt-BR.i18n.json.

You can have more than one file for the same language.

You can put languages files anywhere in your project tree, as long as they are
common to both your server and client - **do not put languages files under
/client, /server or /public**.

Example for languages files:

    en.i18n.json
    {
        "sky": "Sky",
        "color": "Color"
    }

    pt.i18n.json
    {
        "sky": "Céu",
        "color": "Cor"
    }

    fr.i18n.json
    {
        "sky": "Ciel"
    }

    en-GB.i18n.json
    {
        "color": "Colour"
    }

* Do not use colons and periods (see note below) in translation keys.
* To avoid translation bugs all the keys in your package must be translated to
  English ("en") which is the fallback language we use if tap-i18n is not installed,
  or when we can't find a translation for a certain key.
* In the above example there is no need to translate "sky" in en-GB which is the
  same in en. Remember that thanks to the Languages Tags and Translations
  Prioritization (see above) if a translation for a certain key is the same for a
  language and one of its dialects you don't need to translate it again in the
  dialect file.
* The French file above have no translation for the color key above, it will
  fallback to English.
* Check [i18next features documentation](http://i18next.com/pages/doc_features.html) for
  more advanced translations structures you can use in your JSONs files (Such as
  variables, plural form, etc.).  

#### A note about dot notation

Note that `{_ "foo.bar"}` will be looked under `{foo: {bar: "Hello World"}}`, and not under `"foo.bar"`.

### Configuring tap-i18n

To configure tap-i18n add to it a file named **project-tap.i18n**.

This JSON can have the following properties. All of them are optional. The values bellow
are the defaults.

    project-root/project-tap.i18n
    -----------------------------
    {
        "helper_name": "_",
        "supported_languages": null,
        "i18n_files_route": "/tap-i18n",
        "cdn_path": null
    }

Options:

**helper\_name:** the name for the templates' translation helper.

**supported\_languages:** A list of languages tags you want to make available on
your project. If null, all the languages we'll find translation files for, in the
project, will be available.

**build\_files\_path:** Can be an absolute path or relative to the project's root. If you change this value we assume you want to serve the files yourself (via cdn, or by other means) so we won't initiate the tap-i18n's built-in files server. Therefore if you set build\_files\_path you **must** set the browser\_path.

**i18n\_files\_route:** The route in which the tap-i18n resources will be available in the project.

**cdn\_path:** An alternative path from which you want tap-i18n resources to be loaded. Example: "http://cdn.example.com/tap-i18n".

**Notes:**

* We use AJAX to load the languages files so you'll have to set CORS on your CDN.

### Disabling tap-i18n

**Step 1:** Remove tap-i18n method calls from your project.

**Step 2:** Remove tap-i18n package

```bash
$ meteor remove tap:i18n
```

### Using tap-i18n in Cordova apps

In order to use tap-i18n in a Cordova app you must set the `--server` flag
to your server's root url when building your project.

```bash
$ meteor build --server="http://www.your-site-domain.com"
```

**Note:** At the moment tap-i18n works in Cordova apps only when internet connection is available.

## Developing Packages

Though the decision to translate a package and to internationalize it is a
decision made by the **package** developer, the control over the
internationalization configurations are done by the **project** developer and
are global to all the packages within the project.

Therefore if you wish to use tap-i18n to internationalize your Meteor
package your docs will have to refer projects developers that will use it to
the "Usage - Project Developers" section above to enable internationalization.
If the project developer won't enable tap-i18n your package will be served in
the fallback language English.

### tap-i18n Two Work Modes

tap-i18n can be used to internationalize projects and packages, but its
behavior is determined by whether or not it's installed on the project level.
We call these two work modes: *enabled* and *disabled*.

When tap-i18n is disabled we don't unify the languages files that the packages
being used by the project uses, and serve all the packages in the fallback
language (English)

### Setup tap-i18n

In order to use tap-i18n to internationalize your package:

**Step 1:** Add the package-tap.i18n configuration file:

You can use empty file or an empty JSON object if you don't need to change them.

The values below are the defaults.

    package_dir/package-tap.i18n
    ----------------------------
    {
        // The name for the translation function that
        // will be available in package's namespace.
        "translation_function_name": "__", 

        // the name for the package templates' translation helper
        "helper_name": "_", 

        // tap:i18n automatically separates the translation strings of each package to a
        // namespace dedicated to that package, which is used by the package's translation
        // function and helper. Use the namespace option to set a custom namespace for
        // the package. By using the name of another package you can use your package to
        // add to that package or modify its translations. You can also set the namespace to
        // "project" to add translations that will be available in the project level.
        "namespace": null 
    }

**Step 2:** Create your languages\_files\_dir:

Example for the default languages\_files\_dir path and its structure:

    .
    |--package_name
    |----package.js
    |----package-tap.i18n
    |----i18n # Should be the same path as languages_files_dir option above
    |------en.i18n.json
    |------fr.i18n.json
    |------pt.i18n.json
    |------pt-BR.i18n.json
    .
    .
    .

**Step 3:** Setup your package.js:

Your package's package.js should be structured as follow:

    Package.on_use(function (api) {
      api.use(["tap:i18n@1.0.7"], ["client", "server"]);

      .
      .
      .

      // You must load your package's package-tap.i18n before you load any
      // template
      api.add_files("package-tap.i18n", ["client", "server"]);

      // Templates loads (if any)

      // List your languages files so Meteor will watch them and rebuild your
      // package as they change.
      // You must load the languages files after you load your templates -
      // otherwise the templates won't have the i18n capabilities (unless
      // you'll register them with tap-i18n yourself, see below).
      api.add_files([
        "i18n/en.i18n.json",
        "i18n/fr.i18n.json",
        "i18n/pt.i18n.json",
        "i18n/pt-br.i18n.json"
      ], ["client", "server"]);
    });

Note: en, which is the fallback language, is the only language we integrate
into the clients bundle. All the other languages files will be loaded only
to the server bundle and will be served as part of the unified languages files,
that contain all the project's translations.

### Package Level tap-i18n Functions

The following functions are added to your package namespace by tap-i18n:

**\_\_("key", options, lang_tag) (Anywhere)**

Read documenation for `TAPi18n.__` above.

**On the server**, TAPi18n.__ is not a reactive resource. You have to specify
the language tag you want to translate the key to.

You can use package-tap.i18n to change the name of this function.

**registerI18nHelper(template\_name) (Client)**

**registerTemplate(template\_name) (Client) [obsolete alias, will be removed in future versions]**

Register the \_ helper that maps to the \_\_ function for the
template with the given name.

**Important:** As long as you load the package templates after you add package-tap.i18n
and before you start adding the languages files you won't need to register templates yourself.

### Using tap-i18n in Your Package Templates

See "The tap-i18n helper" section above.
